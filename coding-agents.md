# Mosoo API for coding agents

Use this document when integrating an existing, published Mosoo Agent into application code through the public API.

## Integration scope

This document only covers API calls between application code and an existing Mosoo Agent: sending inputs, attaching files, reading outputs, and handling public API errors.

It does not cover:

- Creating, configuring, or publishing Agents.
- Managing Mosoo Apps.
- Managing Agent lifecycle, versions, readiness, runtime settings, model providers, tools, or channels.
- Any other Mosoo product surface outside the public API used to pass input to an Agent and read output from it.

This document is also not the source for secrets or live resource IDs. Do not invent API tokens, `agentId`, `threadId`, `fileId`, or `runId` values. Use values supplied by the user, environment variables, Mosoo UI, or Mosoo CLI when available.

This document is not a replacement for the raw OpenAPI document when generating clients or validating every schema detail. Use the raw OpenAPI for code generation and strict schema validation.

## Integration model

Mosoo is the Agent runtime. The published Agent runs inside a Mosoo-managed sandbox, and your application backend and product code should call that sandboxed Agent through the public API.

Build the app-side integration layer around Mosoo Threads, events, files, and public error handling. Your application can still own backend APIs, jobs, business logic, user flows, and data storage around the sandboxed Agent. For a Mosoo Agent integration, do not implement a parallel Agent layer, sandbox, model loop, planner, tool runner, memory system, lifecycle manager, or provider integration in your application.

Primary contract:

- Human docs: `/docs`, `/docs/quickstart`, `/docs/auth-and-access`
- Raw OpenAPI: `/docs/mosoo-openapi.en.generated.json`
- API version: `v1`
- Base URL used in examples: `https://mosoo.ai/api/v1`

Do not infer request fields that are not listed here or in the raw OpenAPI. The public API rejects unsupported fields.

## What Mosoo exposes

Mosoo exposes published Agents through Thread-based HTTP APIs. If required credentials or resource IDs are missing, get them from the environment, the user, Mosoo UI, or Mosoo CLI when it is available. Do not guess or synthesize Mosoo IDs.

| Concept | Meaning for callers |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | A configured Mosoo Agent. It must be published and have API access enabled before the API can call it. |
| `agentId` | The published Agent ID shown in the Agent API Access panel |
| API token | Bearer credential used by your code. In the current single-user model, it authenticates the Mosoo user who owns the local Agents, Threads, and files. |
| Thread | The API conversation container. It records messages, files, run status, and public event history. |
| Run | One execution pass of the Agent on a Thread. A user message can create or resume a Run. |
| Event | A public timeline entry for Thread inputs, Agent output deltas, tool updates, file changes, status changes, and usage updates. |
| File | A Thread attachment uploaded by the caller or an Agent artifact produced during execution. |

Resource IDs in v1 are bare ULIDs, not prefixed IDs.

## Authentication and access

All API requests require an API token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer mst_...
```

JSON requests also require:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

A valid request must pass all of these checks:

1. The Agent exists.
2. The Agent is published and has API access enabled.
3. The API token is valid and not revoked.
4. The requested Thread or file exists in the same single-user Mosoo workspace.

Mosoo currently exposes this API as a single-user integration surface. The API token authenticates requests for that user; it does not switch users, create a multi-user access context, or let a request override model provider, channel, tool, or runtime settings. Configure and publish the Agent in Mosoo before calling the API.

## Responsibility boundary

| Your application owns | Mosoo owns |
| --- | --- |
| App UI, app routing, app backend APIs, jobs, app-side users, business logic, data storage, `thread.id` persistence, and caller-owned correlation IDs such as `client_external_ref` or `clientRequestId`. | Sandboxed published Agent execution, model/provider configuration, tool execution, Agent runtime behavior, Agent memory/runtime state, and public event generation. |

## Quick start workflow

Use this workflow when implementing the quickstart in application code. It is based on the human quickstart, but it starts after the Agent already exists, is published, and has API access enabled.

| Step | Call | Persist or read | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Load credentials | No API call. Read `MOSOO_API_TOKEN` and `MOSOO_AGENT_ID` from the user, environment, Mosoo UI, or Mosoo CLI. | Keep the token in secret storage. Keep `agentId` as configuration. | Missing token or `agentId`; do not invent either value. |
| 2. Create a Thread | `POST /agents/{agentId}/threads` with the first user input. | Persist `thread.id`. Optionally persist `client_external_ref` for your app record. | A Thread exists and the first Run has been queued. |
| 3. Continue the Thread | `POST /threads/{threadId}/events` with `user_message`, `permission_decision`, or `user_interrupt` events. | Persist caller-owned references such as `clientRequestId` if your app needs correlation. | The follow-up input has been accepted by the API. |
| 4. Read output | `GET /threads/{threadId}/events` for the event log, or `GET /threads/{threadId}/events/stream` for streaming. | Read public Agent output, run status, usage updates, tool status, and file events from events. | The app has enough public events to render the Agent response or current status. |
| 5. Attach files if needed | For small base64 payloads, `POST /threads/{threadId}/files`. For binary or larger uploads, use the file upload flow below. | Persist returned `file.id` when the app needs to reference or remove the file later. | The file is attached before sending the message that depends on it. |

Implementation rules:

- Build the app-side integration layer around the published Mosoo Agent running in Mosoo's sandbox; do not implement a local Agent runtime or replacement sandbox.
- Do not call model providers directly for this Mosoo Agent integration.
- Do not send provider credentials, model configuration, channel credentials, tool configuration, or Agent configuration through this public API.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` for Thread creation and event submission.
- Treat Thread events as the integration contract and `GET /threads/{threadId}/events` as the stable source for results.
- Keep Agent creation, App management, and Agent lifecycle operations outside this workflow.
- On failure, branch on `error.code` and follow the error handling table below.

## Minimal call sequence

Set credentials:

```bash
export MOSOO_API_TOKEN="mst_..."
export MOSOO_AGENT_ID="01J00000000000000000000001"
```

Create a Thread and queue the initial Run:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/agents/$MOSOO_AGENT_ID/threads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: ticket-182-create-thread" \
  -d '{
    "client_external_ref": "ticket-182",
    "input": {
      "type": "user.message",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Triage this customer escalation and suggest next steps."
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Store `thread.id`:

```bash
export MOSOO_THREAD_ID="01J00000000000000000000002"
```

Send a follow-up message:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/threads/$MOSOO_THREAD_ID/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: ticket-182-follow-up-1" \
  -d '{
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "user_message",
        "clientRequestId": "ticket-182-message-1",
        "text": "Give me the three highest-priority next actions."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Read the public event log:

```bash
curl "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/threads/$MOSOO_THREAD_ID/events?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN"
```

## File upload flow

Use this flow when a Thread needs a file attachment. Public uploads are currently single PUT uploads up to 67108864 bytes.

Create a Thread-scoped upload session:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/threads/$MOSOO_THREAD_ID/files/uploads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file": {
      "name": "brief.txt",
      "contentType": "text/plain",
      "size": 19
    }
  }'
```

The response is a `FileUploadSummary`. Store `fileId`.

```bash
export MOSOO_FILE_ID="01J0000000000000000000000J"
```

Upload bytes:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/files/$MOSOO_FILE_ID/content" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  --data-binary @brief.txt
```

Complete the upload:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/files/$MOSOO_FILE_ID/complete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Claim the ready draft file into the Thread:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/threads/$MOSOO_THREAD_ID/files" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileId": "01J0000000000000000000000J"
  }'
```

Use the file in a later user message with `attachmentIds`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mosoo.ai/api/v1/threads/$MOSOO_THREAD_ID/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: ticket-182-file-question-1" \
  -d '{
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "user_message",
        "attachmentIds": ["01J0000000000000000000000J"],
        "text": "Summarize the attached file."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

When creating a Thread, `files[].file_id` can reference ready draft file handles uploaded by the same caller. For Thread-scoped uploads after Thread creation, use the upload flow above and then call `POST /threads/{threadId}/files` with `fileId`.

## Idempotency

`Idempotency-Key` is supported on:

- `POST /agents/{agentId}/threads`
- `POST /threads/{threadId}/events`

Rules:

- The key is scoped to the API token, method, route, and request body.
- Reusing the same key with the same request replays the stored response.
- Reusing the same key with a different request returns `409 idempotency_conflict`.
- Reusing the key while the first request is still processing returns `409 idempotency_conflict`.
- Keys must be non-empty and 128 characters or fewer.
- Conflict responses can include `Retry-After`.

Generate stable keys from your own operation IDs, such as `ticket-182-create-thread` or `job-2026-06-23-run-1-message-3`.

## Reading results

The stable read surface is the Thread event log.

Use `GET /threads/{threadId}/events` for polling and snapshots. Use `GET /threads/{threadId}/events/stream` for long-running consumer UX.

Do not expect event APIs to expose raw runtime payloads, private transcripts, or internal diagnostics. Each event entry has public fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Event ID, bare ULID, monotonically increasing in chronological order. |
| `type` | Public event type such as `run.started`, `agent.message.delta`, `tool.use.started`, or `usage.updated`. |
| `status` | `available`, `error`, or `unsupported`. |
| `content` | Public event content or a reference to the associated payload. |
| `occurredAt` | RFC 3339 timestamp. |
| `durationMs` | Duration in milliseconds when applicable, otherwise `null`. |
| `tokens` | Token count when applicable, otherwise `null`. |

Important event types:

- `user.message`
- `agent.message.delta`
- `agent.thinking.delta`
- `tool.confirmation.required`
- `tool.use.started`
- `tool.use.completed`
- `file.changed`
- `session_files.updated`
- `run.started`
- `run.completed`
- `run.failed`
- `session.status`
- `usage.updated`

## Status values

Thread status:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `IDLE` | No active Run. A user message can queue work. |
| `RUNNING` | A Run is executing. |
| `RESCHEDULING` | The Thread is between runs. |
| `TERMINATED` | The Thread has ended. |

Run status:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | Run exists but has not started. |
| `booting` | Runtime is preparing. |
| `running` | Run is executing. |
| `waiting_input` | Run is blocked on caller/user input, often permission decision. |
| `completed` | Terminal success. |
| `failed` | Terminal failure. |
| `cancelled` | Terminal cancellation. |
| `expired` | Terminal timeout or expiry. |

## Error handling

All non-2xx public API JSON errors use this envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Request body must be an object."
  }
}
```

Branch on `error.code`, not `error.message`. The message is for developers and should not be displayed directly to end users.

| HTTP | `error.code` | Meaning | Caller action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | Request shape, field value, body size, limit, or unsupported field is invalid. | Fix the request. Do not retry unchanged. |
| 400 | `invalid_json` | Body is not valid JSON. | Fix serialization or `Content-Type`. Do not retry unchanged. |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Missing, invalid, or revoked API token. | Re-read `Authorization`; rotate or recreate the API token. |
| 403 | `forbidden` | API token is valid but the operation is not allowed for this Agent, Thread, or file. | Check that the request uses the expected token and a resource from the same Mosoo workspace. |
| 404 | `not_found` | Agent, Thread, or file is not visible in the current Mosoo workspace or does not exist. | Check the ID and use resource IDs returned by the API. |
| 409 | `agent_not_published` | Agent exists but is not published as an active API service. | Ask the user to publish the Agent and enable API access. |
| 409 | `service_inactive` | Published API service has no live published version. | Ask the user to republish or repair the Agent in Mosoo. |
| 409 | `readiness_blocked` | Agent is not ready to run. | Do not blindly retry; ask the user to fix Agent readiness or configuration in Mosoo. |
| 409 | `idempotency_conflict` | Same `Idempotency-Key` is processing or was used for a different request. | If still processing, wait for `Retry-After`; if body differs, use a new key. |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | API token exceeded public API rate limits. | Back off and retry after `Retry-After`. |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Mosoo failed internally. | Retry briefly with backoff; persist failure details if it repeats. |

Retry policy:

- Safe to retry with the same `Idempotency-Key`: network timeouts, 5xx from create-thread or send-events, and `idempotency_conflict` caused by in-flight processing.
- Safe to retry after delay: `rate_limited`, using `Retry-After`.
- Do not retry unchanged: `invalid_request`, `invalid_json`, `unauthenticated`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `agent_not_published`, `service_inactive`, `readiness_blocked`.

### `GET /threads/{threadId}/events`

Purpose: Returns the latest public event log entries for this Thread in chronological order. If older public entries are omitted because the limit was reached, `truncated` is true. Event IDs are stable, so callers can retry or poll without treating the same ID as a new event. This is the stable snapshot read surface for CLI and API consumers; it does not expose raw runtime payloads, transcript, or diagnostics.

Path params:

Error responses:

- `400` `InvalidRequest`: The request shape or query value is invalid.
- `401` `Unauthenticated`: A valid API token is required.

Headers:

- `Idempotency-Key` optional, `string`. Optional key for retry-safe create-thread and send-events calls. Reusing the same key with the same request returns the original response. Reusing the key while the original request is still processing returns 409.

Request body:

- `application/json`: `SendEventsRequest`

Example:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "text": "Say hello from the API.",
      "type": "user_message"
    }
  ]
}

- `500` `InternalError`: The request failed unexpectedly.

### `GET /threads/{threadId}/events/stream`

Purpose: Streams public Thread event log entries as Server-Sent Events. Each `thread.event` data payload uses the same ThreadEventLogEntry shape as GET /threads/{threadId}/events.

The stream is for long-running consumer UX and does not expose raw runtime payloads, internal diagnostics, or private transcripts.

Path params:

- `threadId` required, `string(ulid)`. Thread ID returned by create thread. v1 IDs are bare ULIDs.

Query params:

## Schema quick reference

### `ThreadEventInput`

A single event posted to a Thread. Exactly one variant applies: send a user message, answer a pending permission request, or interrupt a running Run.

Variants:

1. `object`: Send a new user message into the Thread, optionally with file attachments.
   - `resources` optional, `FileResource[]`. Files to attach to this message. Each file must be a ready draft file uploaded through the Agent file endpoint by the same API token.

{/* END GENERATED OPENAPI REFERENCE */}
## Implementation guardrails for coding agents

- Always send `Authorization: Bearer $MOSOO_API_TOKEN`.
- Always treat `agentId`, `threadId`, `fileId`, and `runId` as bare ULIDs.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` for create-thread and send-events retries.
- Use event log APIs as the source for public results.
- Do not assume raw model output, private runtime payloads, or internal diagnostics are exposed.
- Do not send provider credentials, model configuration, channel credentials, or Agent configuration through this public API.
- Do not retry invalid requests unchanged.
- Do not treat `403` as an authentication problem; `403` means the token was understood but the operation is not allowed for that resource.
- Do not treat a published Agent as ready unless create-thread succeeds or the user confirms Agent readiness in Mosoo.
- Prefer stable caller-owned references such as `client_external_ref` and `clientRequestId` for correlation.
